    This is a prototype of a roguelite game. I was planning to add inventory, gear, additional character stats and currency. But the killer feature of the game would be sync with calendars and customize events so that the player can gamify his tasks in real life. At the time of the prototype, one location and one event were realized

    many situations can be resolved by violence. The wolf event is no exception

    every event has a luck option. It depends on luck and is often able to either save the player from a hopeless situation or make it worse
